2011/12/01 - Rather than wait longer to get these files in a form that
makes sense, I am committing them to github as they are without making
sense. If you are able to figure this out without documentation, you
are truly ahead of the curve. I couldn't. If you need the
documentation, PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL ME AND ASK FOR IT. The
documentation will be the very next thing I do on this project, so
please be patient. You can watch at:

https://github.com/evilgeniuschronicles/Kindle-Language-Dictionaries

to find out when that is committed.

Priorities:

1. Document the process of taking these files and creating a working
Kindle dictionary.  

2. Update the translation script. In the time since I wrote this hack,
Google has closed this loophole and now requires you to go through
their API (and charges money for it.)

3. Create generalized procedures for creating a dictionary for any
language to another language.

Submit patches and feedback and anything but requests for instruction
on using these files to dave@daveslusher.com. Thank you for your
interest and if you want to thank me, go to

buy something sometime.
